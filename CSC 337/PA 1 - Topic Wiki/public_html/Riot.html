			Riot Games, Inc. is an American video game developer, publisher and esports tournament organizer. Its headquarters are in West Los Angeles, California. Founded in September 2006 by Brandon Beck and Marc Merill to develop <a href="./index.html" style="text-decoration:none"> League of Legends</a>, the company has gone on to develop several spin-off games of League and an unrelated first-person shooter, Valorant. As a publisher, Riot Games oversees the production of League spin-offs by other developers through its publishing arm, Riot Forge. Since 2011, Riot has been a subsidiary of Chinese conglomerate Tencent.

            Riot operates 14 international League of Legends esports leagues, the League of Legends World Championship and the Valorant Champions Tour. The company, which had 24 offices worldwide as of 2018, sells corporate sponsorships, merchandise, and streaming rights for its leagues. Riot has faced allegations of a toxic workplace culture, including gender discrimination and sexual harassment. The company's response was criticized for its use of forced arbitration.

		<h2> History </h2>

			Riot Games' founders, Brandon "Ryze" Beck and Marc "Tryndamere" Merrill, became friends while roommates at the University of Southern California, where the two studied business and bonded over video games. Beck and Merrill believed too many video game developers diverted their focus from game to game too often, distinguishing Defense of the Ancients as an indication that games could be supported and monetized long-term. They also drew inspiration from Asian video game designers who released their games for no up-front cost and instead charged for additional perks.

			Beck and Merrill sought funding from family and angel investors, raising US$1.5 million to launch their company. Riot Games was established in September 2006 and opened an office in an old, converted machine shop under an Interstate 405 overpass in Santa Monica, California. The first person Riot Games recruited was Steve "Guinsoo" Feak, one of the early developers of DotA Allstars, a game considered to have been foundational to the <a href="./MOBA.html" style="text-decoration:none"> MOBA </a> genre. As they refined League of Legends' initial creation, they pitched investors a video game company rooted in e-commerce. Merill said that they approached publishers who were baffled by the game's lack of a single-player mode and free-to-play business model. After several rounds of funding totalling $8 million, including investments by the Benchmark and FirstMark Capital venture capital firms, as well as Chinese holding company Tencent, who would later become League of Legends' distributor in China.

            Following six months of beta tests, Riot Games released League of Legends as a free-to-play game on October 27, 2009. Their game designers and executives participated in online forums to make adjustments based on player feedback. On May 10, 2010, Riot Games announced that they would take over distribution and operation of their game in Europe; to do so, Riot Games relocated their European headquarters in Brighton to new offices in Dublin. In February 2011, Tencent invested $400 million for a 93 percent stake in Riot Games. Tencent bought the remaining 7 percent on December 16, 2015; the price was not disclosed.
