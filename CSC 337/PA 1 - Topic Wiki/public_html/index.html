			League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League, is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by <a href="./Riot.html" style="text-decoration: none"> Riot Games</a>. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre. Since its release in October 2009, the game has been free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character customization. The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS.

		    In the game, two teams of five players battle in player versus player combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map. Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a "champion", with unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, champions become more powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. In the game's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and destroying their "Nexus", a large structure located within.

		<hr style="width:100%;text-align:left;margin-left:0">
		<p>
			League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena (<a href="./MOBA.html" style="text-decoration: none">MOBA</a>) game in which the player controls a character ("champion") with a set of unique abilities from an isometric perspective.As of April 2021, there are 155 champions available to play.Over the course of a match, champions gain levels by accruing experience points (XP) through killing enemies.Items also increase the strength of champions, and are bought using gold, which players accrue passively over time and earn actively by defeating the opposing team's minions, champions, or defensive structures. In the main game mode, Summoner's Rift, items are purchased through a shop menu that is only available to players when their champion is in the team's base. Each match is discrete; levels and items do not transfer from one match to another.

					On 3 June 2020, Uzi announced his retirement from professional gaming, citing health concerns. In a statement he said, "As a result of staying up late for years, a fatty diet and being under insurmountable stress, last year I found out that I was type-2 diabetic." He added that his mental state was "not as good as it was before". In an effort to recover, he took medication and made changes to his work schedule and exercise habits, but his situation did not change. His doctor told him there could be "serious complications" if he continued playing competitively.
