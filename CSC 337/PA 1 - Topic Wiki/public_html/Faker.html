			Lee Sang-hyeok (Korean: 이상혁; born May 7, 1996), better known as Faker (Korean: 페이커), is a South Korean professional <a href="./index.html" style="text-decoration: none" > League of Legends </a> player for T1. Formerly known as GoJeonPa (Korean: 고전파) on the Korean server, he was picked up by LCK team SK Telecom T1 in 2013 and has played as the team's mid laner since. He is widely considered to be the best League of Legends player of all time.

			Lee is renowned for his high mechanical skill and extremely versatile champion pool. He is best known for playing LeBlanc, Zed, Syndra, Azir, Ahri, and Ryze. He is the first player to have reached 1,000 and 2,000 kills in the LCK, the second to have played 500 games, and the first to have played 600 games.

			Lee is one of the only two players to have won the League of Legends World Championship three times, having done so in 2013, 2015 and 2016. He has also won the All-Star Paris 2014, the Mid-Season Invitational tournament in 2016 and 2017, and the IEM World Championship in 2016. He owns three different League of Legends skins as a result of winning World Championship, which include SKT T1 Zed (2013), SKT T1 Ryze (2015) and SKT T1 Syndra (2016).

			Lee became a part owner of T1 Entertainment & Sports in early 2020.

		<p>
			Lee was born in Seoul on May 7, 1996. He and his brother were raised by their grandparents and their father, Lee Kyung-joon, in Gangseo District, Seoul. Lee always loved puzzles and video games, often playing custom maps for Warcraft III and the <a href="./MOBA.html" style="text-decoration: none"> MOBA </a> Chaos during his teenage years. He discovered League of Legends in late 2011, and quickly became adept at the game. He attended Mapo High School, the same high school that Deft of Hanwha Life attended, but dropped out to join SKT T1 K and pursue a career in esports.

			<li><h3> Season 3 </h3>
			<p>
				Lee was picked up by SK Telecom T1 K in 2013 as their starting mid laner. SKT T1 K dominated the Korean scene, and in October 2013, Lee led them to win their first League of Legends World Championship. Later in the HOT6iX Champions Summer 2013, Lee cemented his status as a brilliant player due to his perfect outplay against KT Rolster Bullets mid laner Yoo "Ryu" Sang-wook, which would then become one of the most iconic moments in League of Legends history.

			<li><h3> Season 4 </h3>
			<p>
				In 2014, SK Telecom T1 K followed their success through in the OGN winter season, making the entire run without dropping a single game. They would then go on to win All-Star Paris 2014. However, their Winter season success did not follow through and during the Spring and Summer seasons, SKT T1 K failed to qualify for the 2014 World Championship. In the following offseason, <a href="./Riot.html" style="text-decoration: none">Riot Games</a> changed the team regulations so that each organisation can only have one team participating in each league. This led to the merger of SKT T1 K and SKT T1 S, and the subsequent departures of Impact and Piglet for the NA LCS. The new team would compete under the name SKT T1.
